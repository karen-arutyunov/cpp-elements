BASE_OPERATORS_HEADING Basic operations ALL, ANY, SITE, URL

BASE_OPERATORS_INTRO \
\
News Fiber provides ALL, ANY, SITE, URL <span class="op_form">basic operations</span> for searching posts by \
words they contain or by source location news posts come from.

ALL_SEARCH \
\
<span class="op_def">Operation ALL</span> have the <span class="op_form">ALL term...</span> form where \
<span class="op_form">term</span> is a word or a phrase taken into double or single quotes. \
Operation return just those posts which contain all specified terms. Operation name declaration is optional. \
If enter only search terms then News Fiber will "guess" that word ALL is assumed at the beginning. Search is performed with \
no respect to character case, this why <span class="inline_example">fly Moon</span> and <span class="inline_example">fly moon</span> \
searches give the same result. Search is performed with no respect to word forms as well, so <span class="inline_example">tournament winner</span> and \
<span class="inline_example">tournaments winners</span> searches are identical. When you search for phrases, News Fiber will display \
only those posts which have no punctuation marks between words inside a phrase being searched. \
There is a difference between taking search phrases into single or double quotes. \
When phrase is double quoted then words should appear in posts in exactly same \
form to be found. When phrase is single quoted then word form is not taken into account. \
So 'space shuttle' will find all 3 phrases:<br>... the space shuttle \
Atlantis ... all space shuttles ... space shuttle's fuel tank ...<br>\
while "space shuttle" will find only the first phrase.

They get evaluated in the order of operation priority decrease and from the left \
to the right for operations with the same priority. Evaluation order can be changed \
by means of parenthesis. AND and EXCEPT have equal priority, which is higher \
than that of OR operation. \
