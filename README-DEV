The  purpose of this document is to provide instructions for preparing a setup 
that can be used to develop the Elements library. This setup can also be used 
to support dependent projects being configured in a similar  way. By the time 
of this writing the only dependent project is the NewsGate Server.

We will assume that this and dependent projects reside in ~/projects directory.
If that is not the case you need to adjust instructions accordingly. By now
the development binary package (containing the reqired compile and runtime 
dependencies for Elements) should be installed. [ What are the instructions for
that package installation? Should we put it into the Elements source 
directory? ]

Clone the Elements and change the current directory to the project's one.

$ mkdir ~/projects
$ cd ~/projects
$ git clone git@github.com:newsgate/Elements.git
$ cd Elements

Run OpenSBE script which creates configure script.

$ osbe

Create the build output directory as well as default.config file with the 
compilation options that should be used for the build. You can use cpp 
preprocessor to generate such a configuration file from default.config.t 
template passing some controlling macros to the preprocessor (read comments in
default.config.t for details). You can also adjust specific compile options
in the generated configuration file.

$ mkdir build
$ cpp -DDEBUG -DARC_x86_64 -DORB_TAO  default.config.t > ./build/default.config

Now you can generate Makefiles corresponding to your compile options.

$ cd build
$ ../configure --enable-no-questions=yes

Finally compile and test the project. Use appropriate arguments for make 
utility. Testing is a bit verbose and takes some time.

$ make -j8
$ make check
